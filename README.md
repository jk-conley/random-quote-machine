This is my first project in Javascript at treehouse. After learning the basics of variables, conditionals (if, else, and switch case), loops, functions, arrays, and objects. It was a lot fo fun and helped me understand how to take a bigger project and break it down into parts. Along with a better understanding of the basics in programming.
